# ResumeWebsite
AngualrJS Application

This is the source code to a resume website I created to showcase my skills and accomplishments.

The application is built in AngularJS and featues a custom CMS built with AngularJS, PHP, and MySQL.
The CMS source can be found in the "Admin" directory.

The Less files are compiled using Grunt.
